# Sprint 1 â€“ Build a hero video section

There is a great design trend right now where websites contain a top section with background image or video. It's called hero video or hero image. Today you're building one!

The goal of today's assignemnt is to create a hero video that is responsive and retrieves the right video file depending on the size of the screen using media queries.

As inspiration, we'll look at [confetti.events homepage](http://confetti.events/). They have a big video section at the top of the page. Over the video you can see a title and a button.

We will use the smallest format (360x240px) for mobile, second largest (720x480px) for tablets and the largest format (1280x720px) for desktop.
